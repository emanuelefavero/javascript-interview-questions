# Debounce and Throttle Techniques

Understanding the concepts of **debounce** and **throttle** is crucial for optimizing the performance of web applications, especially when dealing with user inputs, API calls, or any operations that can fire frequently.

## Debounce

**Debounce** is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, causing high loads on the performance. It does this by delaying the execution of the function until a certain amount of time has passed without any subsequent calls. It's particularly useful in situations like:

- User ends typing in a search box
- Window resize
- Button clicks for forms with validation

### How debounce works

1. When the user triggers an event (like keystrokes).
2. The debounce function starts a timer.
3. If the user triggers the event again and the timer is still running, it resets.
4. Once the timer completes, the function executes.

## Throttle

**Throttle** is a technique that ensures a function is only executed at most once in a specified time period. It's different from debounce as it doesn't delay the execution but instead enforces a maximum number of times a function can be called over time. It's useful in situations like:

- Scrolling events in a web page
- Game character movements
- Data streaming

### How throttle works

1. The user triggers an event.
2. The throttle function is called.
3. If a certain time has not elapsed since the last call, the function will not execute.
4. If the specified time has passed, the function executes.

## Key Differences

- **Debounce**: Delays the function execution until after a specified time has elapsed since the last time the debounced function was invoked.
- **Throttle**: Ensures that the function is only called at most once during a specified time period.

## Conclusion

Both techniques are essential for improving the user experience and the performance of web applications by limiting the number of times certain functions are called. Use debounce for delaying the function execution until after some idle time and throttle for guaranteeing a steady call of function over time.
