# Code Debugging Tools and Navigation Buttons

## Introduction

This document provides a quick guide to common buttons and tools used in debugging code within various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

### 1. Continue

- **Description**: Resumes the execution of the program until the next breakpoint is encountered or the program terminates.
- **Use Case**: Use when you want to proceed with program execution after a breakpoint pause.

### 2. Step Over

- **Description**: Executes the next line of code, but does not step into any function calls.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for bypassing function calls that you do not need to debug.

### 3. Step Into

- **Description**: Executes the next line of code and steps into any function calls.
- **Use Case**: Use to delve into the details of a function call.

### 4. Step Out

- **Description**: Continues executing the program until the current function returns, then pauses.
- **Use Case**: Useful for exiting the current function if you have finished debugging it.

### 5. Breakpoint

- **Description**: A marker set by the developer where the debugger will pause execution.
- **Use Case**: Place at a point in the code where you want to inspect variable values or program behavior.

### 6. Run to Cursor

- **Description**: Runs the program up to the location of the cursor.
- **Use Case**: Quick way to run to a specific line without setting a permanent breakpoint.

### 7. Watch

- **Description**: Allows you to monitor the value of specific variables or expressions as the code executes.
- **Use Case**: Monitor how and when data changes during the debugging process.

### 8. Call Stack

- **Description**: Shows the stack trace of the function calls leading up to the current point of execution.
- **Use Case**: Understand the sequence of function calls and navigate through them.

### 9. Evaluate Expression

- **Description**: Evaluate variables or expressions on the fly to see their current values.
- **Use Case**: Useful for checking or modifying values without changing the source code.

## Conclusion

Understanding these tools enhances your ability to efficiently debug and navigate through your code, leading to quicker resolution of issues and deeper insights into program behavior.
